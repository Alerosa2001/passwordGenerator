Password Generator Application
This is a simple yet powerful Password Generator application, which allows users to generate random passwords based on their specific criteria. The app provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing, giving users control over the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The backend is implemented using Java to generate secure and random passwords.

Features
Customizable Password Generation: Choose from different character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols) to create your ideal password.
Password Length: Specify the desired length of the password.
User-Friendly GUI: Easy-to-use interface with clearly labeled options and toggles for customization.
Cross-Platform: Built using Java, this application works on any platform with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
Requirements
Java 8 or higher: Ensure that Java is installed on your system.

You can check if Java is installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
java -version
If Java is not installed, you can download it from the official Java website.

How It Works
Backend (PasswordGenerator): The PasswordGenerator class generates random passwords. It allows users to specify the password length and which character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) to include in the password.

Frontend (PasswordGeneratorGUI): The PasswordGeneratorGUI class creates the graphical interface. It provides fields for the user to input the desired password length and toggle options for including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. When the user presses the "Generate" button, the application uses the PasswordGenerator class to create a random password and displays it in the GUI.

Features of the GUI
Password Display: A text area shows the generated password.
Length Input: Allows the user to specify the length of the password.
Character Type Toggles: Four toggle buttons allow users to choose whether to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols in the generated password.
Generate Button: Generates a new password based on the user's selected criteria.
Sample Usage
When the application is running, the user can:

Enter a password length (e.g., 12).
Toggle the character type options to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols.
Press the "Generate" button to create a random password based on the selected criteria, which will be displayed in the text area.
Example
Length: 16 characters
Character Sets: Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
Generated Password: fL$4g#1tJ2B^9aS1
